The encounters include: 

- Small Enemies: Will normally include enemies that can be beaten with the dagger. (Slimes, wolves, etc.) and be bypassed with the cloak.

- Mobile enemies: Will only be passable with the dagger by defeating them. Players using the cloak will be spotted and the game will end.
